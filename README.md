DiffuTrapKv

Simulation of diffusion and trapping in 2D of a molecule (tetramer) of a given size (molecule diameter) onto fixed interaction sites. 
In the tetramer there are 1 up to 4 number of interacting subunits (Cter). Creates trajectories of the tetramers similar to those of single particle tracking.
